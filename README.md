# Hello!, I'm Onyi you can also call me Dre!

I'm a Software Developer and Product Designer from Toronto,Canada.

👀 I’m interested in Front-End Software Development, UX/UI Design and collaborating on freelance development, design and marketing conent creation projects with clients.

Outside of working on these lovely projects, you'll most likely find me pretending to lift weights🏋🏽, bike riding trails🚲, camping 🏕, or enjoying a glass of aged smokey bourbon or dry red 🍷.
