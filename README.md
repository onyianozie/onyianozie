# Hello!, I'm Onyi you can also call me Dre!

I'm a Multimedia Specialist turned Web Developer and Product Designer from Toronto,Canada.

👀 I’m interested in Front-End Software Development and UX Design and I'm currently learning Web Development as well collaborate on development and design projects.

I'm also currently learning Javascript, Python and React.

Outside of working on lovely projects, you'll most likely find me pretending to lift weights🏋🏽, bike riding trails🚲, camping 🏕, or enjoying a glass of dry red 🍷.
