# Hello!, I'm Onyi you can also call me Dre!

I'm a Multimedia Specialist turned Web Developer and Product Designer from Toronto,Canada.

👀 I’m interested in Front-End Software Development and UX/UI Design and I'm currently learning Web Development at Juno College of Technology, as well as collaborating on freelance development, design and marketing conent creation projects with clients.

I'm also currently learning Javascript, Python and React.

Outside of working on these lovely projects, you'll most likely find me pretending to lift weights🏋🏽, bike riding trails🚲, camping 🏕, or enjoying a glass of aged smokey bourbon or dry red 🍷.
