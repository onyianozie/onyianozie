# Hello!, I'm Onyi you can also call me Dre!

I'm a Software Developer, Digital Product Designer and a Certified Scrum Master from Toronto,Canada.

👀 My passions lie within Development, Digital Product Design and Building businesses.

Outside of working on these lovely projects, you'll most likely find me pretending to lift weights🏋🏽, bike riding trails🚲, camping 🏕, or enjoying a glass of aged smokey bourbon or dry red 🍷.
