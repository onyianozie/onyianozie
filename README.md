# Hello!, I'm Dre!

I'm a Frontend Developer, Digital Product Designer, and a Certified Scrum Master.

👀 My passions lie in Software Development, Digital Product Design, Project Management, and Business Development.

Outside of working on these lovely projects, you'll most likely find me pretending to lift Iron🏋🏽, bike riding trails🚲, camping 🏕, or enjoying a glass of aged smokey bourbon or dry red 🍷.
